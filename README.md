## ✅ Core Features

### 💬 AI Chatbot (Simulated with Hardcoded Replies)
- Interprets and responds to customer queries in a conversational format.

- JWT-based login system.
- Two roles: **Core User** and **Admin User**
  - **Core User:** Can register, login, and chat.
  - **Admin User:** Has full control to manage data (future feature placeholder).

### 📊 Secure and Responsive UI
- Built using React + Vite.
- Styled with **custom CSS** for lightweight performance.
- Mobile-responsive design with smooth UX.

### 🔐 Authentication & Session Management
- Secure login & registration flow with hashed passwords.
- Persistent user session using JWT tokens stored in `localStorage`.
